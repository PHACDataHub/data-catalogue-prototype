Data for CCVCSS are collected every four weeks, and a regular report is produced on this same cycle for the Canadian Immunization Committee (CIC) and online publication. In addition, CCVCSS provides denominator tables to CAEFISS (see above) for the calculation of rates of AEFI associated with COVID-19 vaccines.

To do this, CAEFISS identifies increases in the frequency or severity of previously identified vaccine-related reactions and identifies previously unknown adverse events following immunization (AEFIs) that could possibly be related to vaccines. The data can be used to identify areas that require further investigation and/or research and provides timely information on AEFI for vaccines marketed in Canada, to  that can help inform immunization-related decisions, including regulatory action and vaccination guidance via NACI.

Data from the survey were weighted to permit representative estimates of each of three nursing bodies -- registered nurses, licensed practical nurses and registered psychiatric nurses -- at the provincial level. Because of the relatively small number of nurses employed in the Yukon Territory, the Northwest Territories and Nunavut, estimates were produced for the territories combined. While RNs and LPNs are employed throughout Canada, RPNs are found almost exclusively in Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta and British Columbia. The survey did not include retired or unemployed nurses.",

    "Description (English)": "SIVCS collects information about the annual uptake of the flu shot in Canada. Each flu season, the SIVCS surveillance system uses survey data to estimate how many people were vaccinated that year as well as knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs about the flu shot. Every two years, the survey also collects information about other recommended vaccines for adults, including: pertussis (whooping cough), tetanus, pneumococcal disease, and shingles. Results from the survey provide information about how well Canadian adults are protected against vaccine preventable diseases, broken down by gender and age group, as well as what they know and think about vaccines. Survey results are used to measure progress towards achieving Canada's national vaccination coverage goals, determine reasons for non-vaccination, identify potential impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on seasonal influenza vaccine uptake, assess how well vaccination programs are working and how they could be improved, and report Canada's vaccination coverage to the World Health Organization. Reports are produced annually and data are available since 2015.",

Given that laboratory exposure incident data are currently lacking in Canada and internationally, data from this system will inform evidence-based decision-making. Data inputs in this surveillance system are self-reported, accuracy is validated through the ongoing investigatory process involving both PHAC and the reporter.
